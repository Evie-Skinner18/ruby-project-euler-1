# Project Euler: Problem 1

**If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.**

*Solution: 233168.*

I set myself the challenge of solving this in Ruby. First I used a method, and then I refactored my code using object-orientated programming in order to achieve the suitable separation of concerns.

My next step will be to write a test for this program using Rspec.
